Section Three:
Imagine yourself in the following situation, and then tell me what you will do.
1. Imagine you need guidance from the technical manager to complete a task, and
you've asked them a question that the task's success relies on their answer. However,
they might not be able to respond for some reason. In such a situation, what would
you do?
2. Imagine that the system encounters a very serious bug. Initially, you are confident
that your code is not the issue, and you inform the whole team that the problem must
not have been caused by your side. The team is investigating the code to find the
problem, and you assume they won't discover what caused the bug, but during your
own investigation, you realize that the bug was indeed caused by your code. What
would you do in this situation?
3. Imagine that a part of the platform is supposed to be presented to important
individuals, and the technical manager was initially assigned to do it. However, the
technical manager cannot attend at the scheduled time for some reason. The
company's manager asks you to present the system instead of the technical manager.
What would you do in this situation?
4. Imagine in a company setting that someone mocks your activities and occasionally
says that you don't have enough capability and skills for this position, and you always
mess things up. What would you do in such a situation?
5. Imagine we are close to a very important product release, and all team members
decide to allocate more time to meet the deadline. However, you have the option not
to exceed the defined timeline. What would you do in this situation?
